# HCI_LAB
Lab material of HCI course

This repository contains implementations of methods discussed in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) lectures on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). The methods covered are divided into local and global techniques for enhancing AI model interpretability.

#Local Methods

HCI-lecture-6-XAI-Interpretable-models.pptx: Implementations for making individual AI predictions more interpretable.
HCI-lecture-9-XAI-Local-methods.pptx: Additional local methods for explaining single predictions.

#Global Methods

HCI-lecture-7-XAI-Interpretable-models-and-global-methods.pptx: Techniques for gaining an overall understanding of AI model behavior.
HCI-lecture-8-XAI-Global-and-local-methods.pptx: Presentation slides on global and local XAI methods.
